# Artificial Intelligence WS 2018/2019
In this codebase I implemented some of the problems and solutions presented in the Artificial Intelligence class of my masters degree. The class is based on the book *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by *Stuart Russell* and *Peter Norvig*.


## Goals
* Describe problems in a unified way (see abstract_problems.py).
* Implement generic solving strategies that operate on these abstract problems (see abstract_strategy.py).

This is also a nice opportunity to play around with the type hints introduced in Python 3.5 and abstract base classes as described in PEP 3119.


## Prerequisites
Python 3.5 or greater.
